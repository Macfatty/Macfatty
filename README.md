## Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a **Deep Dive DevOps Project**, where I'm building and automating a blog deployment using **CI/CD, AWS, Kubernetes, and Terraform**.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **K3s (lightweight Kubernetes), Terraform, and advanced CI/CD automation**.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on **DevOps-related projects, Kubernetes deployments, and CI/CD automation**.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with **optimizing infrastructure as code (Terraform) and Kubernetes security best practices**.
- 💬 Ask me about nothing as I’m still new to this, but if you are as new as I am, ask me about **Docker, GitHub Actions, MongoDB integration, and automated backups to AWS S3**.
- 📫 How to reach me: **ayuuub.mn@outlook.com**.
- 😄 Pronouns: **He/Him**.
- ⚡ Fun fact: **I spent 4 hours trying to figure out why my Ubuntu installation was crashing at the last part, only to realize I was using the boot memory for the installation instead of the regular disk... lel 🤦‍♂️**.

I am open to getting to know new people that I can seek knowledge from and perhaps learn from. 🚀  

- Next project is to build a mini RC with the ability to drive with goggles and a stick, like how small drones fly—something I would like to try! 🏎️🎮
